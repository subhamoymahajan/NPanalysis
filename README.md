NP(nanoparticle)analysis is a tool to analyze nanoparticle properties in all-atom or coarse-grained molecular dynamics systems. The scripts are written for DNA-PEI nanoparticles, but can be used for other two-component nanoparticles. It can currently only read [Gromacs](https://manual.gromacs.org/archive/5.0.4/online/gro.html) **.gro** and **.xvg** files generated by Gromacs to calculate different properties:

1. Connection matrix of molecules
2. Number of molecules performing different roles
3. Cluster analysis to calculate different molecules in a nanoparticle
4. Calculating the size of the nanoparticle in terms of number of molecules of one type (DNA or PEI)
5. Calculating size distribution of nanoparticles
6. Charge of nanoparticles as a function of size
7. Make nanoparticles whole across periodic boundaries
7. Radius of gyration, and hydrodynamic radius of nanoparticle as a function of time
8. Radius of gyration, and hydrodynamic radius of nanoparticle as a function of size

## Published work

This toolbox is based on published work:

[1] Mahajan S., and Tang T., Polyethylenimineâ€“DNA Ratio Strongly Affects Their Nanoparticle Formation: A Large-Scale Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Study, *J. Phys. Chem. B*, **2019**, 123, 45, 9629-9640, DOI: [10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b07031](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b07031)

## Installation

NPanalysis can be installed as a module using
 
```bash
python setup.py install --user
```

## Quickstart

For details check Tutorials.

### Prepare Gromacs files

First make molecules whole across periodic boundaries and output **.gro** files:

```bash
gmx trjconv -f md_1.xtc -s md_1.tpr -pbc whole -o Whole/DP.gro -sep
```

Output the mass data:

```bash
gmx dump -s md_1.tpr > tpr.dump
```

### Prepare and read constants

Generate a constants file 'constants.dat':

```bash
ndna = 27 # number of DNA 
npei = 270 # number of PEI
adna = 154 # number of DNA atoms
apei = 13 # number of PEI atoms
Qdna = -22 # Charge of DNA
Qpei = 3 # Charge of PEI
sdna = 1 # first atom of DNA
spei = 4159 # first atom of PEI
contact_dist = 0.5 # contact distance threshold
pbc = xyz

```

Read constants from the file and pickle it:

```python
import NPanalysis as NPa
NPa.pickle_constants('constants.dat')
```

Generate molecule ID index or read it:
```python
NPa.gmx.gen_index_mol('molndx.pickle')
NPa.gmx.read_index('index.ndx')
```
Read and pickle mass information:

```python
NPa.gmx.pickle_mass('tpr.dump')
```

### Calculate connection matrix

This can be calculated from any gromacs strucrture files, molecules does not need to be whole.

```python
NPa.connMat.gro2connected(inGRO='Whole/DP')
```
Calculate PEI roles:

Average over 50 timesteps and output to 'PEI\_roles.dat' and 'PEI\_roles2.dat'. **get\_roles()** calculates the number of PEIs in free, peripheral, bridging PEIs. **get\_roles2()** calculates the average number of bridging PEIs between a pair of bridged DNAs and total number of bridged DNAs.

```python
NPa.connMat.get_roles(50,'PEI_roles.dat')
NPa.connMat.get_roles2(50,'PEI_roles2.dat')
```

### Determining clusters (nanoparticles)

Calculates clusters in 'cluster.pickle': connection matrix has to determined before this calculation.

```python
NPa.cluster.gen_cluster()
```

Calculate cluster properties: Number average size, weight average size, number of nanoparticles as a function of number average size, charge of nanoparticles as a function of number average size. 

```python
NPa.cluster.gen_avgsize(50,'avgsize.dat')
NPa.cluster.gen_ncNP_s(3,'num_charge_NPs_size.dat')
```

### Make nanoparticles whole

Input gromacs files must have whole molecules, connection matrix and clusters has to be calculated.
```python
NPa.gmx.make_NPwhole(inGRO='Whole/DP',outGRO='NPwhole/DP')
```

### Radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius

Calculate radii for each cluster at different timestep: radius of gyration is stored as square. The input gromacs must have whole nanoparticles. Clusters has to be known.

```python
NPa.radius.calc_Rh_Rg(Rh_pickle='Rh.pickle',Rg2_pickle='Rg2.pickle',inGRO='NPwhole/DP')
```

Calculate average radii: the average is performed over every 50 timesteps. Square root of average and standard error is taken for radius of gyrtion. 

```python
NPa.radius.gen_rad_avg('Rh.pickle',50,'avg_Rh.dat')
NPa.radius.gen_rad_avg('Rg2.pickle',50,'avg_Rg.dat',sqrt=True)
```

Calculate average radii per number average size: the average is calculated over timestems 200 throug 251 (not included). Square root of average and standard error is taken for radius of gyration.

```python
NPa.radius.gen_rad_per_size('Rh.pickle','Rh_size.dat',200,251)
NPa.radius.gen_rad_per_size('Rg2.pickle','Rg_size.dat',200,251,sqrt=True)
```
